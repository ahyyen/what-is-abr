        <p>This summer, I went to France. This is Palais Garnier, aka the Paris Opera House.</p>
            
        <div class = "stageImg">
            <p class = "hidden" id="line2">It was a breathtaking world. I could imagine entire lives taking place within the walls of this building. Not just on the stage. Everywhere.</p>

            <img class="sagittalFigs hidden" src="sagittalFigs.png">
            <p class="hidden" id="line3">Scientific research. They way in which we "uncover" the truth of the world. Numbers. Measurements. Objectivity. "Empiricism." That's what we're taught, anyway.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class = "modelOutput">
            <p class="hidden" id="line4">But we don't see the world as numbers. We see it as <i>stories.</i></p>

        <p class="hidden" id="conclusion">So...what exactly is arts-based research? I'm gonna be completely honest, I couldn't tell you (yet). But the logic of using human experience (art) in the process of understanding the world (research)? It does make sense.</p>
